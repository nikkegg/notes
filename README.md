# Notes

This is a collection of notes/interesting things I learnt about technologies I
worked with in the past. Mostly here because I remember things better after
writing them down, but also stops me from Googling the same thing over and over.
I try to keep these organised, but only with partial success, and the wole thing
turned out to be a little TIL-style.
